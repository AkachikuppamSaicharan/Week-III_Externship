    How to Create An Data Augmentation and How to Load Image Files is Taught 
    and Saved in 30_03_2023_Session(II)_Week_3 File
    Images Are Loaded
    Keras and Tensorflow is Used
    Environment Must Be Pip If You Use A System of Config Windows 11
    The Four Convolutional,Pooling,Flatten and Dense Layer Are Shown
    Images Must be Scaled Shifted Translated and Reduced and Rescaled to Obtain More Features
    The Output Must Be in the Form of Traning (120,120) Input Not any Another
    So Translation and np.Dimension_Expansion is Done and Tested

## 31-05-2023(Week-III)(Session-III)
    Learn About Tuning the Models
    Using Increasing the Layers Like Convolutional and MaxPooling Layers Between    the First Convol and Flatten Layer
    Otherwise Use DroupOut,EarlyStop and BatchNormalization Model
    You Will See Callbacks of Keras.callbacks 
## 01-JUN-2023(WEEK-III)(Session-IV)
    You Will Learn About LSTM RNN(Recurrent Nueral Network)
    Might There a Chance to Learn More About Model Tuning Like Transfer Learning
